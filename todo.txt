for thinking
  docs ast
  object and model modifier
  'is' keyword (model B is A)
  try to use const (will ready with metadata) for loops

  for statement with else branch:
    for item in items:
      someAction()
    else:
      throw Error("No items")




drafts:
  arrays:
    value: {1, 2, 3}[1]
    type: ...Number
    type: { Number }
    type: { Number }[Number]
    value: { { 'some' = 2 } }[0]['some']
    type: { { ...Number } }

move all parse functions to helpers

Model
Class is Model
Object is Class
